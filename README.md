# Recycle-ifier:   
## Overview:
Recycle-ifier, is an android application which classifies whether the captured image contains Organic or Recycleable items and also outputs the coresponding probability of prediction. In addition to this users can also "Submit captured Images" to us, with which we can further optimize and improve the neural network model for better accuracy and predictions. The name Recycle-ifier is derived from two words which are- Recyclable and classifier. As the main function of the app is to classify if image has Recycleable or Organic items.

<br>
Here, Tap:<br>Capture Image : To capture an image and predict the class of the Image. (Organic / Recycleable)
<br>Submit Image : To submit an image to us for further improving accuracy of predictions.
<br>
<br>
5. Optionally, For Submiting data, First press "Choose" button to browse and select an Image. 
<br><br>

## Repository Contents:

1. Android Application ( Recycle-ifier android )
2. Python Notebooks ( jupyter notebook(s) used for training the Neural network )
3. App Screenshots. ( Images )

## Future Enhancements:
Adding prediction/detection of multiple items of different classes captured at realtime. It can also be used in an IOT based device too for further automating the process of waste segregation.
